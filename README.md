# Finding the most common 7-mer in a FASTA file

## Your task

Write a script to print out the most common 7-mer and its GC percentage from all the sequences in `data/records.fa`. You are free to reuse your existing toolbox.

- The example FASTA file was adapted from: Genome Biology DNA60 Bioinformatics Challenge.

## Hints

- FASTA files have two types of lines: header lines starting with a ">" character and sequence lines. We are only concerned with the sequence line.
- Read the [string functions documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html).
- Read the [documentation for built in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).

## Challenges

- Find out how to change your script so that it can read from data/challenge.fa.gz without unzipping the file first (hint: standard library).
- Can you change the parser so that there is an option flag to tell the program whether the input file is gzipped or not?
- Can you change your script so that it works for any N-mers instead of for just 7-mers?
